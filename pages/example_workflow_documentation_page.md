## Description

> Introduction of workflow and its component tools.
> Table with embedded registry links.


## Diagram

Logical visual description of processing steps for workflow


## How to cite this workflow

> Add citation instructions here.


## User guide


### Quick start guide

> General guide for deployment across multiple infrastructures (distinct from specific infrastructure quick start guide)


### Install

> General installation guide.

> If there are different installation requirements for specific compute infrastructures you could indicate these here, or in an individual infrastructure documentation template: https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/infrastructure_optimisation.md


### Dependencies & third party tools


### Required (minimum) inputs/parameters

> The minimum inputs required for the workflow to run.


### Recommendations for use on specific compute systems

> + link to installation instructions for each infrastructure 
> + recommendations
    
> Documentation for a specific infrastructure should go into a infrastructure documentation template
https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/infrastructure_optimisation.md


### Benchmarking (compute resource usage on tested infrastructures)

> Table with high level compute resource usage information for standalone runs or testing of specific versions on specific computational infrastructures.

> Benchmarking for a specific infrastructure should go here: if this document is complicated it should go into a benchmarking template, or be provided elsewhere (e.g. Zenodo).
